GitHub Repositories Search is a Ruby on Rails application that enables users to search and discover GitHub repositories based on keywords, providing essential repository details and links for easy exploration.

### Key files

    
    app
    ├── controller                     
    │      └── repositories_controller  
    │
    |
    ├── services
    |      └── github_repository_search_service.rb 
    |
    └──  views
            └── repositories (_search_form, _repository_card, index)
    

### Workflow - How does it work?

* Enter Search Query: Users can input a search query, e.g. a GitHub repository name, into the search bar on the home page.
* Search Execution: When the user submits the search query, the application sends a GET request to the GitHub API using the provided query.
* Retrieve Repository Data: The application receives a response from the GitHub API, which contains a list of repositories matching the search query.
* Display Results: The retrieved repositories are displayed as cards on the search results page, showing essential details such as repository name, owner's username, description, programming language, star count, and fork count etc.
* Visit Repository: Users can click on the "Visit Repository" button within each card to navigate to the respective GitHub repository on GitHub's website.
No Results Message: If no repositories match the search query, the application displays a message indicating that no repositories were found.

#### Note
